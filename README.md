Next tram
=========

Wanted to know when the next tram goes? This is the solution. Easy to use webapp showing countdown towards next tram. Works only for Brno, Czech Republic.

Uses [http://idsjmk.cz/odjezdy/](http://idsjmk.cz/odjezdy/) to fetch next tram and [worldtimeengine.com](worldtimeengine.com) to get the exact time.

Done for [techsquat.com](http://techsquat.com).

Well... Show me

Next tram from tram stop TÃ¡bor (Brno, Czech Republic): [techsquat.com/nexttram](http://techsquat.com/nexttram)

I desperately want to use it!
-----------------------------

Yeah, yeah... Just change the URL for fetching the next departure time. Just that. Now go. Hush! Go! Change it!

I love you, guys!

No need. Just buy us a beer next time we meet.
